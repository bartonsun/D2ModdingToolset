/** This custom message fixes a network desync issue described below.
 * The issue is that client may send multiple CStackMoveMsg while server still processes the first
 * one. This will typically lead to client game crash.
 * One of the known occurrences is a crash on entering a battle:
 * 1. A client sends CStackMoveMsg to a server while targeting an enemy stack
 * 2. The client increments CMidObjectLock::pendingNetworkUpdates
 * --- While CMidObjectLock is locked, client is not allowed to send further commands ---
 * 3. The server receives CStackMoveMsg and begins to process a list of possible effects
 * (IEventEffect)
 * --- Lets assume the most simple case where the first event to process is CEffectMove ---
 * 4. The server processes CEffectMove and sends CmdMoveStackMsg back to the client (followed by a
 * number of CRefreshInfo messages) and continues to process the list of events
 * --- Here assume that the server got a little busy processing all the events ---
 * 5. The client receives CmdMoveStackMsg and resets CMidObjectLock::pendingNetworkUpdates
 * 6. The player's stack is visually moved toward an enemy stack, but the battle is not yet to begin
 * --- Now client is free to send further commands to the server! ---
 * --- Here comes the interesting part. ---
 * 6. The player relentlessly clicking on the enemy stack sends another CStackMoveMsg to the server
 * 7. The server finally processed all the events to find out that there should be a battle to
 * begin!
 * 8. The server sends CCmdBattleStartMsg to the client
 * 9. The client receives CCmdBattleStartMsg and starts a battle
 * 10. Now guess what: the server receives another CStackMoveMsg (but the client is already in
 * battle!)
 * 11. The server manages to ignore the fact of battle already going, and sends another
 * CCmdBattleStartMsg to the client
 * 12. Finally, the client receives CCmdBattleStartMsg while already being in battle and happily
 * crashes to desktop
